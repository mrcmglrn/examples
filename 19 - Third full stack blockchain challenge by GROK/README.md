# Task 3: NFT Minting dApp (6 hours)

## Description:

  - Create a Solidity ERC721 contract for minting NFTs. Deploy it to a testnet.
  - Build an Express backend to intercact with the contract.
  - Build a React frontend to mint NFTs via MetaMask.
  - Include a function to view minted NFTs.

## Skills Tested:

  - Solidity: ERC721 contract development.
  - Node.js/Express: Backend API for blockchain interaction.
  - React: Frontend for user interaction.
  - MetaMask: Transaction signing.
  - Git: Version control.

## Deliverables:

  1. ERC721 contract with mint and tokenURI functions.
  2. Deployed contract on Sepolia.
  3. Express API endpoints for minting and querying NFTs.
  4. React frontend with a "Mint NFT" button and NFT display.
  5. Git repository.

## Steps:

  - Write an ERC721 contract using OpenZeppelin.
  - Deploy using Hardhat/Foundry.
  - Create Express endpoints for minting and fetching NFT data.
  - Build a React UI with MetaMask integration for minting.
  - Commit to Git with clear messages.
