# Task 4: Decentralized Voting System (6 hours)

## Description: 

  - Develop a Solidity contract for a voting system where users can vote for candidates.
  - Build an Express API to interact with the contract.
  - Adding a React frontend to display candidates.
  - Allow voting via MetaMask.

## Skills Tested:

  - Solidity: Complex contract logic with state management.
  - Node.js/Express: API for contract interaction.
  - React: Dynamic UI updates.
  - MetaMask: Transaction handling.
  - Git: Version control.

## Deliverables:

  1. Solidity contract with vote and getResults functions.
  2. Deployed contract on a testnet.
  3. Express API to vote and fetch results.
  4. React frontend showing candidates, vote button, and results.
  5. Git repository.

## Steps:

  - Write a voting contract with vote counting and access control.
  - Deploy using Hardhat/Foundry.
  - Create Express endpoints for voting and result retrieval.
  - Build a React UI with MetaMask integration for voting.
  - Push to Git.
